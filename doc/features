- Parses fragments of Scala code using the Scala compiler
- Takes a string and returns a `List` of simple tokens
- Tokens represent newlines, spaces and content, for easy transformation into other formats, like HTML
- Content includes metadata to indicate its nature
- Erroneous content may also be parsed
- Parsing is fast; a short fragment will typically take a few milliseconds
